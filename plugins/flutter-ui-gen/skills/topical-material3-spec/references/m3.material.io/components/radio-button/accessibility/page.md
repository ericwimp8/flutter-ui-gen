# Radio button

Source: https://m3.material.io/components/radio-button/accessibility

## Use cases

People should be able to do the following with assistive technology:

- Navigate to a radio button
- Select a radio button
- Get appropriate feedback based on input (Inputs are devices that provide interactive control of an app. Common inputs are a mouse, keyboard, and touchpad.) type

## Interaction & style

A radio button can be either selected or unselected. Selecting one radio button deselects any others. A radio group can start with one radio button selected, or none selected.

Once a radio button is selected, the group can’t be deselected. To let people opt out of their selection, either provide a Not applicable or No option radio button, or provide a separate way to deselect all radio buttons, like Clear selection.

People should be able to select either the text label or the radio button to select an option.

*Only one radio button is selected at a time*

### Avoid applying density by default

Don't apply density to radio buttons by default. This lowers their targets below Material's recommendation of 48x48 CSS pixels. Instead, give people a way to choose a higher density, like selecting a denser layout or changing the theme.

To ensure this density setting can be easily reverted when it's active, keep all targets to change it at a minimum of 48x48 CSS pixels each.

## Initial focus

When outside the radio group, Tab moves focus directly to the selected radio button, or the first one if none are selected.

Shift+Tab instead focuses on the last radio if none are selected.

Use the arrows to navigate between options.

## Keyboard navigation

| Keys | Actions |
| --- | --- |
| Tab | Moves focus into the group to the selected radio button, or the first if none are selected |
| Shift + Tab | Moves focus into the group to the selected radio button, or the last if none are selected |
| Arrows | Moves focus and selects the previous or next radio button. Wraps focus and selection between the first and last radio buttons. |
| Space | Selects a focused radio button. If already selected, does nothing. |

## Labeling elements

If the UI text is correctly linked to the radio button, assistive tech such as a screenreader will read the UI text, followed by the component’s role.

The accessibility (Accessible design makes products usable for people with all kinds of abilities. [More on accessibility](https://m3.material.io/m3/pages/overview/principles)) label for a group of radio buttons is typically the same as its title. The role is Radio group.

The accessibility (Accessible design makes products usable for people with all kinds of abilities. [More on accessibility](https://m3.material.io/m3/pages/overview/principles)) label for an individual radio button is typically the same as its adjacent text label.
