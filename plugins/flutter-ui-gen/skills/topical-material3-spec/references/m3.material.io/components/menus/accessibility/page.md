# Menus

## Use cases

People should be able to do the following using assistive technology:

- Navigate to, open, and close a menu
- Navigate between and select menu items

## Interaction & style

Menu items need certain cues to clearly show when they're selected:

- By default, menu items change shape and color when selected
- The default color contrast is 3:1 between selected and unselected menu items
- It's recommended to include another visual cue, like a checkmark

*Use multiple visual cues like color, shape, and icons to show that an item is selected*

## Flexibility & slots

Use caution when adding slots to menus:

- Make sure the menu remains accessible
- Elements must follow the rules and interaction patterns of the menu component
- Keep the same menu item padding
- Targets should be 48x48dp or larger

Don't add buttons, switches, or other direct actions into the menu item. Nested elements should only perform one action. Adding multiple actions can break keyboard navigation and screen reader functionality.

*Caution Reserve the use of slots for use cases that maintain the menu’s accessibility and functionality*

## Focus

Initial focus

When a menu opens, focus should be placed on the first menu item. This allows people using a keyboard or other assistive technologies to begin navigating the menu immediately.

Exiting a menu

People expect to exit a menu by:

- Selecting an option
- Tapping Escape or outside of the menu
- Using the system back button (Buttons let people take action and make choices with one tap. [More on buttons](https://m3.material.io/m3/pages/common-buttons/overview))

Where focus is placed after closing the menu depends on the app.

## Interactability

Disabled (A disabled state communicates a non-interactive component or element. [More on disabled state](https://m3.material.io/m3/pages/interaction-states/applying-states#4aff9c51-d20f-4580-a510-862d2e25e931)) menu items can receive focus but aren't selectable.

Dividers and gaps can't receive focus.

## Labeling elements

Accessibility (Accessible design makes products usable for people with all kinds of abilities. [More on accessibility](https://m3.material.io/m3/pages/overview/principles)) labels are used with assistive technology devices like screen readers.

The accessibility label should be the same as the menu item text.

The role is [dependent on platform](https://m3.material.io/m3/pages/menus/accessibility#9c562e2c-da3a-4212-a2e3-ac91ba450b65).

| Element | A11y label | Role (Web) | Role (Android Views) | Role (Jetpack Compose) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Menu item text | Preview | Menu item | Generic actionable element | Generic actionable element |

For menu items with text and an icon, the icon’s accessibility label should be marked as decorative to avoid redundant verbalizations.
