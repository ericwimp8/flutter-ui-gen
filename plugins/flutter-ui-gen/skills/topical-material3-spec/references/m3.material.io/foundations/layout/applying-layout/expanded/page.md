Layouts for expanded window size classes are for screen widths 840dp to 1199dp.

## Navigation

Place navigation components close to edges of the window where they’re easier to reach.

Use a navigation rail or persistent navigation drawer.

The navigation rail can be hidden in secondary destinations as long as the primary destination can still be accessed using a back button.

For sorting, filtering, or secondary navigation, use tabs or other components directly in the body.

## Body pane

Use a single pane layout or two-pane layout.

A two-pane layout is often best for expanded window classes. However, a single pane layout can work when displaying visually dense or information-dense content, such as videos.

When using a fixed and flexible layout, the fixed pane should have a width of 360dp by default.

A split-pane layout uses two flexible panes and visually centers the spacer by default.

## Spacing

Expanded layouts have a left and right margin of 24dp.

The spacer between panes is 24dp.

## Special considerations

An expanded layout will need to transition dynamically to a compact or medium layout when:

- A foldable device is folded
- A tablet is rotated from landscape to portrait
- The app goes from full-screen to split-screen
- Multi-window mode is initiated
- A free-form window is resized
